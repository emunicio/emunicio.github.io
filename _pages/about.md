I am a Telecommunication Engineer and PhD in Computer Science. I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Researcher at imec - University of Antwerp, in the context of ultra-reliable IoT networks and end-to-end network programmability through SDN, network orchestration, TSN and network slicing techniques.

I received a B.Sc+M.Sc. degree of Telecommunication Engineering from the Madrid Polytechnic University (UPM) in 2013 and a M.Sc degree in Networks and Computer Systems from the King Juan Carlos University (URJC) in 2014. I obtained a PhD in Computer Science in the University of Antwerp in 2020. I have been (and I still am) involved in several European research projects such as FP7 TUCAN3G, Celtic+ FlexNet, H2020 ProTego, H2020 InterConnect, H2020 Vital-5G and H2020 DAEMON.

I have published more than 30 research papers in various peer-reviewed journals and conferences. My main research interests are: traffic engineering and network slicing, SDN, programmable wireless networks, TSN and ultra-reliable Industrial IoT. I am also interested in testbed experimentation, smart cities deployments, community networks and connectivity provision in rural environments.

My PhD studies allowed me to specialize in programmable networks and Industrial IoT, acquire in-depth knowledge of both wired and wireless data networks, and gain strong analytical and problem solving skills. However, I have always liked technical and low-level tinkering, so I also have significant hands-on experience in embedded programming, multi-domain testbeds (e.g., Fed4FIRE, Chameleon) and field deployments. Some of these deployments, such as a 25-node long-range Industrial IoT network formed by bicycles in the Pyrenees, a rural high-andean wireless mesh network or a carrier-grade low-cost backhaul network in the Amazon basin, game me some more expertise in development cooperation ICT4D projects and connectivity provision in rural and challenging environments.

My hobbies are flamenco guitar, astrophotography, and cycling. Specially when done together with more people!
