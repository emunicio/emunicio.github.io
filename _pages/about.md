I am a Telecommunication Engineer and PhD in Computer Science. I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Researcher at imec - University of Antwerp, in the context of ultra-reliable IoT networks and end-to-end network programmability through SDN, network orchestration, TSN and network slicing techniques.

I received a B.Sc+M.Sc. in Telecommunication Engineering from Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid (UPM) in 2013 and a M.Sc in Networks and Computer Systems from the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (URJC) in 2014. I got a PhD in Computer Science at Universiteit Antwerpen in 2020. I am (and have been) involved in some European research projects such as FP7 TUCAN3G, Celtic+ FlexNet, H2020 ProTego, H2020 InterConnect, H2020 Vital-5G and H2020 DAEMON.

I have published about 30 research papers in various peer-reviewed journals and conferences. My main research interests are: traffic engineering and network slicing, SDN, programmable wireless networks, TSN and ultra-reliable Industrial IoT. I am also interested in testbed experimentation, community networks and connectivity provision in challenging environments.

My PhD studies allowed me to specialize in programmable networks and Industrial IoT, acquire in-depth knowledge of both wired and wireless data networks, and gain strong analytical and problem solving skills. However, I have always liked technical and low-level tinkering, so I also have significant hands-on experience in embedded programming, multi-domain testbeds (e.g., Fed4FIRE, Chameleon) and field deployments. Some of these deployments, such as a long-range Industrial IoT network formed by bicycles in the Pyrenees, a high-andean wireless mesh network or a carrier-grade low-cost backhaul network in the Amazon basin, gave me some expertise in development cooperation ICT4D projects and rural connectity.

My hobbies are flamenco guitar, astrophotography, and cycling. Specially when done together with more people!
